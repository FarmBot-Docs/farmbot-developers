No technology is ever perfect, and FarmBot believes that working with skilled security researchers and our entire community of users across the globe is crucial in identifying weaknesses in our technology. **If you believe you’ve found a security issue in our product or service we ask that you notify us privately at security@farm.bot as soon as possible so that we may work with you to promptly fix the issue.**

content="Please, do NOT publicly post about the issue on GitHub, in the FarmBot forum, or in other public places on the Internet. Publicly posting a security vulnerability before a fix is developed may threaten FarmBot and its users and cause more harm than good."

# How to responsibly identify and disclose security issues
  * Upon discovery of a security issue, privately let us know as soon as possible and we’ll make every effort to quickly resolve the issue. You can email us at security@farm.bot. Please include as much information as possible so that we may more quickly diagnose the root cause of the problem.
  * Provide us a reasonable amount of time to resolve the issue before you make any disclosure to the public or a third-party. We request that you give us at least 30 days of time for us to recreate the issue, identify the root cause, develop and test a fix, and deploy the new system(s) to our users.
  * While researching the security of our systems, we’d like to ask you to refrain from:
    * Denial of service
    * Spamming
    * Social engineering (including phishing) of FarmBot staff or contractors
    * Any physical attempts against FarmBot property or data centers

Thank you for helping keep FarmBot and our users safe!
