In October of 2018, our small team gathered at FarmBot HQ in California to envision what we wanted our 3rd party developer experience to be. Through a post-it note brainstorming exercise, we decided that a great developer experience should be **versatile**, **simple**, have **approachable onboarding**, and be **based in community**. Below are the specific resources and attributes that we think define each of these pillars.

# Versatile
- There are available libraries
- The resources are modern
- There are minimal dependencies required
- Cross-platform/XYZ agnostic
- Deployment is easy

# Simple
- Things are stupidly simple
- Documentation/resources are unified
- It is easy to authenticate and integrate
- There is low conceptual overhead
- There are no surprises
- Things are explicit/intent-based

# Approachable onboarding
- When getting onboard, you feel like a kid in a candy store
- Documentation is use-case centric ("applied")
- You learn by doing
- Documentation is interactive
- Things are discoverable
- Low compile or no compile required
- Great tools are available
- Documentation is kept up to date
- No prior knowledge is assumed

# Based in community
- The experience is engaging
- We are inclusive
- The experience is empowering
- There is community support
- Documentation is updated/no dead-ends
