There are multiple ways to gather information about FarmBot while it is running:

# FTDI cable
Almost all development for FarmBot OS is done using one of these. You can purchase one [here](https://www.adafruit.com/product/954). This will allow you to connect a PC to FarmBot to see very verbose logs about what is happening internally to FarmBot.

# SSH
As of the v15 release, SSH access has been completely removed from FBOS.

# Connect a monitor
This is the least useful, but can help in a crunch. The same logs are displayed on the HDMI port, although you won't be able to scroll them, and you are stuck either copying them or taking a picture (preferred).
