OpenFarm is used by the FarmBot project and was created with help from members of the FarmBot team. Although FarmBot relies on OpenFarm for data, **OpenFarm is a free-standing project that operates independently from FarmBot**.

Developer documentation is available [here](https://github.com/openfarmcc/OpenFarm/wiki).
