# "Farmware installation failed"

Verify the following:
* The URL you are providing for installation points to the __raw__ Farmware `manifest.json` file. (If using GitHub to host your Farmware, the URL should start with `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/`.)
* The `manifest.json` file is valid JSON.
* The `zip` URL in `manifest.json` points to the __raw__ `.zip` file including your Farmware code.

# "Farmware execution failed"

There are several ways to determine what went wrong:
* Try running the Farmware code on your computer. (`pip install --user farmware_tools` first if you are using Farmware Tools. See [more about Farmware Tools](../farmware.md#more-about-farmware-tools) for details.)
* Use an FTDI cable to view low-level device logs. `stdout` and `stderr` are sent here.
* Try catching the error as shown below. This method will not catch syntax errors, and should be used only for temporary debugging purposes on the device.


```python
import farmware_tools

try:
    code
except Exception as error:
    farmware_tools.device.log(repr(error))
```

# The web UI is unresponsive when I run my Farmware

Here are some facts to keep in mind when developing a _performant_ Farmware:

 * A log message (or RPC) requires a screen update at the UI layer.
 * An update to the bot's state (such as a change in the `sync_status`)  requires a screen update at the UI layer.
 * A screen update requires CPU resources

Therefore, an unusually high number of log messages (or operation causing the botâ€™s state to change too often, such as polling) will consume all of the browsers CPU resources.

Some things to look for are:

 * Sending too many RPC messages at one time
 * Sending too many logs
 * Performing a polling operation (Doing RPCs on a timer)

content="A warning sign that you are sending too many logs is that the server \"throttles\" your device.
You will receive a message similar to this if you are throttled:  `\"Device is sending too many logs (%s). Suspending log storage and display until %s.\"`"
%}

## How to fix a slow Farmware

 * Avoid sending excessive logs
 * Consider using an event-based architecture instead of performing [polling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polling_computer_science). With few exceptions, **polling (particularly across a network) is almost always an architectural mistake**.
